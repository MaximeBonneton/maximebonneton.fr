                    <div>
                        <p>
                            My professional history begins after 5 years of study in the school
                            engineer from <span class="smallText"> Télécom Saint Etienne. </span> 
                            After this long period of theoretical learning, my first desire
                            was to find a job as an engineer focused on human relations and
                            the communications.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div><i class="fa-solid fa-graduation-cap"></i></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>                        
                            And it was on this decision that I left the black lands of Saint Etienne
                            to sail through troubled waters on the other side of the Rhône. The company
                            <span class="smallText">SPIE ICS</span> trusted me to carry out the engineering mission
                            business in the Rhône Alpes region.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Commerce, project management, skills development over a very broad scope of
                            technology,... I braved the waves <span class="smallText">with determination </span> in the direction of my
                            professional and personal goals.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Everything was going for the best when suddenly...  <span class="smallText"> COVID19... </span> Change of
                            working conditions, loss of speed of skill development,
                            wage stagnation, a bad routine that sets in,...
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div><i class="fa-solid fa-virus-covid"></i></i></div>

                        <p>                        
                            This step was for me a big questioning of my orientation
                            professional. And it was at the end of 2021 that I took <br> <span class="smallText">two major decisions</span> :
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To change of scenery (literally)</li>
                            <li>Getting your hands dirty</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div><i class="fa-solid fa-signs-post"></i></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Very well, who says new life, says new country...  <br>Heading for <span class="smallText">New Zealand</span> !
                            Why New Zealand? If there is a country more beautiful than France,
                            it is undoubtedly the land of the Kiwis (and you can surf there all year round).
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            So today I have arrived at my destination, with the firm intention of changing things...
                        </p>

                            I uninstall my life as a Gamer (RIP League of Legend) to train myself during
