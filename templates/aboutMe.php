        <h2>About Max</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                My professional career started after 5 years of study at <br>
                <span class="smallText"> Télécom Saint-Etienne </span> engineer school, in France.
                After all these theoretical learnings, my first desire
                was to find a job as a business engineer, focusing on human relations,
                communications and management.
            </p>

        <div>
            <p>
                So I decided to leave the city of Saint-Etienne to reach Lyon,
                the gastronomic capital of France.                      
                The company <span class="smallText">SPIE ICS</span>, specialized in 
                information and telecommunications services, trusted me 
                to carry out the mission of pre-sales engineer throughout the region.

        <div>
            <p>
                Thus, I developped business issues, I managed projects and I increased my skills over a very large scope of
                technology... I sailed through the waves <span class="smallText">with determination </span>, to reach my
                professional and personal goals.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-trend-up"></i></div>
        <div>
            <p>
                My job was going well, when suddenly...  <span class="smallText"> COVID19... </span>
                My working conditions changed, everything was running out of steam,
                my wage stagnated, so as my skill. In brief, an unpleasant routine settled.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div><i class="fa-solid fa-virus-covid"></i></i></div>
        <div>
            <p>                        
                At this moment, I questioned my professional orientation.
                So, at the end of 2021 I made <span class="smallText">two major decisions</span> :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Taking a break and a breath of fresh air (litterally speaking)</li>
                <li>Getting my hands dirty to start a technical job</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div><i class="fa-solid fa-signs-post"></i></div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Therefore, who says new life, says new country...  <br>Let's go to <span class="smallText">New Zealand</span> !
                Why this country ? Because to me, if there is a country more beautiful than France,
                it is undoubtedly the land of the Kiwis (and you can surf whenever you want!).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div><i class="fa-solid fa-plane-departure"></i></div>
        <div>
            <p>
                So today I have reached my destination, and here I am, more motivated than ever!

            <p>
                After having set my Gamer life aside (RIP League of Legend),
                I decided to train myself on specific technologies, languages ​​and skills during
                my free time.
                <br><br>
                My current upskillings:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Websites development: HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>
                <li>Introduction to Ethical Hacking</li>
